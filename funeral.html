      <p>Posted atop a rock-hill, a mighty ant stood, after traveling far beyond the main trails of his colony. The scent was thin, nearly indetectable, but he knew what he’d sensed. Another scout had gone out before him and hadn’t returned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although danger was all around him, he was not scared. He lived not for himself, but for the colony and his Queen. His duty comes above all else.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trail-scent led him onwards through the magnificently beautiful forest floor. He raced through a battlefield of insect on insect warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every few moments he tapped his feelers to the ground to make sure he still had the trail left by the previous scout.
      </p>
      <p>
        Onward he pressed until a new scent arose in the air. It pungently wafted through the air, the mark of the fallen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon sensing the last chemical echo of his brethren’s death, he pressed on with new zeal and now changed duties.

        He came upon the fallen hero laying dead on a mossy tree, stricken down by an unknown attacker.
      </p>
      <p>
        With his mandibles he lifted his fallen brother and turned around to follow his own trail back to the colony.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way, the ant sang softly.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Brother me, brother we, your duties have ended, brother me, brother we, your…”
      </p>
      <p>
        As he got to the main trails, other fellow ants joined in singing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The body got passed out of the ant’s mandibles near the entrance to the colony home.

        In the brief moment his feelers sensed no new orders, he paused.
      </p>
      <p>
        As his mind had nothing to cling onto in the moment, he drifted. All the other ants hastily walked all around him and he suddenly felt very, very alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Surrounded by his brothers, everything terrified him.
      </p>
      <p>
        His feelers sensed new chemicals that stimulated him and centered his mind on a task, freeing the burden of the future.
