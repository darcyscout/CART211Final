      <p>The Nomads galloped across the plains. Their hooves sunk deep into the ground as they kept pace with each other; kicking up coarse dirt. Their clan hadn’t been in these fields before, but they didn’t have to, to know them.
      </p>
      <p>
        They pathed thunderously across the fields with a heated tension. Two mustangs led the charge, while the rest of the clan tried their best to catch up with them. One mustang was dark brown, the other, older was splashed with white.
      </p>
      <p>
        They both knew, if they kept their pace, they would tire out the whole clan. It was inevitable that they would face each other. Neither wanted to be the one to stop and challenge the other, but there isn’t enough room for the both of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The white-splashed elder of the mustangs tired first. As his gallop slowed, the rest of the clan behind stopped. The younger brown mustang heard the thunder behind him fade and circled in a wide, dramatic arc. The older, stood there waiting, with the clan standing not far behind him.

        As the younger came around, the mustangs locked eyes. The brown horse slowed its pace to a walk and began to circle his white-splashed mentor. The older forcefully exhaled and began to circle as well. They weren’t that much different in age; they’d grown up like brothers.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now, as they were both fully grown, the tension each day was too great between leadership. The rivalry they both wanted to avoid was too great a strain on the clan, it tore the tightly knit group apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        They walked close to each other cautiously, ready to spring to action. If they were the fight, the loser would go battered and bruised on their new adventure alone, or worse. If they fought, it could sever bonds, break friendships and lose lineages.
      </p>
      <p>
        As they got closer and closer, neither made a move, until they right next to each other; head to head. They’d both battled their fighting instinct because of the bond they had.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their muscles relaxed and a peaceful moment went by. Suddenly, the young brown horse reared, startling everyone.

        He galloped off, up a shallow hill, and onto the crest. He took one last look at his old family on that windy day. His heart couldn’t bear it any other way, than to say goodbye the right way.
