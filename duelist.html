        “Everyone is standing by, too afraid”
      </p>
      <p>
        The grumbling bighorn sheep scowled at another.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Or they’re just too lazy, waiting for a catastrophe to come before they do anything about it”
      </p>
      <p>
        The grumbler followed at the tail end of a caravan. They walked on ahead of him, up the trail and banking right, underneath a cliff. The one in particular he was scowling at was the Queen’s personal guardsman, Razor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Razor shuffled along next to Queen and occasionally grazed for some stray grass in the rocky path.
      </p>
      <p>
        “This has gone long enough, maybe they don’t see his weakness, but I do” The Grumbler mumbled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Grumbler leaped up through the path, weaving past other members of the caravan with haste. The startled line of caravanners turned to see who was jumping around with such impoliteness. Grumbler finally landed right behind Razor, who stood in between him and the Queen.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Settle down scout, you must hold your pace to endure this journey” The Knight Captain said in a noble tone.

        Grumbler looked him straight ahead and said, “I challenge, that you haven’t been tested in a while, too long in fact”
      </p>
      <p>
        Razor stared down those threatening words meanwhile using his tongue to scrape the last bits of mashed grass from his teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        “This is really not the time fo-” Razor was cut off when Grumbler pushed off his front legs and balanced himself on his hinds. Razor too bounced up onto his hinds to build strong momentum.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two sheep, screamed in tandum “Heeeeee Yaaaaa” as they smashed their horns together with superb force.
      </p>
      <p>
        They charged each other over and over and over and over…
      </p>
      <p>
        Until the Knight Captain could not endure any longer and yielded. But Grumbler hadn’t noticed he’d yielded and charged him with all his might and sent Razor rolling all the way down the trail.

        “You two ruffians!” The Queen shrieked, “look what you’ve done” she said, now talking to Grumbler.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Knight Captain groaned way down the trail, “Ooooh my leg”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Go down there and help him you stupid idiot!” The Queen ordered Grumbler.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Shit” Grumbler mumbled.
